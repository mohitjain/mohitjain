Its been 2 years, that I was thinking to learn vim and use it for my day to day coding. Few days back I took it seriously and started learning Vim, Checked out lot of videos guides, tested few things. Tried it at home and today I feel I am on that level that I can use Vim for my primary editor.

So here is what I followed to learn Vim for ruby on rails:

1.  [Derekwyatt][1] have an awesome beginners videos for vim. Check it out. Very first step for vim. (Free series)
2.  [Checkout this series][2] which explains some 8 vim plugins. (Free series)
3.  [Tutsplus][3] has a awesome beginners guide for Vim. Although its paid but I found it as investment to learn and its worth spending some money just to speed up the things. (Paid)
4.  [Thoughtbot][4] also has a vim guide specific for rails. Although its not that good but its fine cause its specific to ruby on rails and tells you most of the things which you can find in[ tim – pope vim for rails plugin][5] documentation. (Paid)
5.  Finally you need to download a lot of plugins, setup some commands etc in vimrc etc. Better you take that someone is using. Here is the [one][6] I got from my friend [Jigar Patel][7] (Thanks to him) and I am using the same. Awesome as it has all the plugins etc that one need and another shortcuts etc are perfect. (Free)
6.  A good color scheme. I tried few themes and finally I loved codeschool and I am using it for ever. Hunt for good color scheme ends [here @codeschool][8].
