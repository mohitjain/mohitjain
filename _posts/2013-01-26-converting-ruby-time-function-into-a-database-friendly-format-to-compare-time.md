Use to_s(:db) to convert Ruby time function into a database friendly format to compare time.

{% highlight ruby %}
    Time.now.to_s(:db)
{% endhighlight %}
However, be careful if you have a timezone specified in Rails because the time will be stored in UTC in the database. Youâ€™ll need to specify that to do proper comparisons.

{% highlight ruby %}
    Time.now.utc.to_s(:db)
{% endhighlight %}
You can also use NOW() function in MySQL instead of generating the current time in Ruby.
