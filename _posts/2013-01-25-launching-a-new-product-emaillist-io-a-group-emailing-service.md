You try to send a mass email? And maybe a few minutes later you realize you forgot someone. Then what? Send him again?

We are tying to fix this problem with the new product ie [EmailList.io][1], learnings from our previous product ie textadda.com. For FREE, you create an email address, such as myfriends@emailist.io, and then add up to 25 people to the recipient list. Now anytime you or any of the groupâ€™s members email myfriends@emailist.io, the email goes to everyone.

Remember only people in the group can send an email to that address. So what are you waiting for. Signup and create a list and start sending emails ;)

So just signup and do let us know your feedback ;)[http://emaillist.io/][1]
