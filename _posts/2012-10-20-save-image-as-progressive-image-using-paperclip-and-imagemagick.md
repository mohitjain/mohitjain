We all have upload image functionality in our web apps. But we people donâ€™t optimize the images uploaded by the user.

Here are the two quick things you can do to optimize your images:

1.  Reduce the quality of the pictures. You need to take the call, How much?
2.  Save images as progressive pictures.

# How to do save image as progressive image using paperclip:

## Before:

{% highlight ruby %}

    has_attached_file :attachment, {
      :styles => {
        :medium => ["654x500>", :jpg],
        :thumb =>["200x200#", :jpg]
      }

{% endhighlight %}

## After:

{% highlight ruby %}

  has_attached_file :attachment, {
    :styles => {
      :medium => ["654x500>", :jpg],
      :thumb =>["200x200#", :jpg]
    },
    :convert_options => {
      :medium => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane",
      :thumb => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane"
      }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

## -quality 80 -interlace Plane
 is the code which do all the magic behind the screens. 80 is the factor of reducing image quality and interlace plane saves the image as progressive image :)

Let the more suggestions come for image optimizations.
