I was working on my project and got a very strange error. I was not able to call any group model methods in delayed job perform the method. Checking out wiki of delayed job I got this:

*Thereâ€™s a strange edge-case with Ruby/Rails where Struct::Group already exists, so calling Group.anything from within a class that inherits from Struct will have strange results. You can workaround this issue by prefixing calls to Group with two colons. For example, ::Group.find or ::Group.other\_methods\_defined\_in\_model would work as expected*
