Every one makes mistakes, mistakes that they never forget, cause they are so stupid and you can just smile to see those mistakes. Today I made one and they messed things so badly that it took me 5 hours to figure why its happening.
Mistakes were pretty simple but hard to figure out cause I made a method ie destroy in a model and a scope update in another one and screwed up everything. Donâ€™t override core Rails methods like create, new, update destroy etc in any models. Shit happens..
