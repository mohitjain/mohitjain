I got couple of requests to release the source code running this blog as few people liked the theme :) Glad to hear that. I am sorry for being so late to release the code.If you want to download the code feel free to fork the repo from [github](https://github.com/mohitjain/codebeerstartups). Design credits goes to my friend Taroon Tyagi.

Stack:

* Heroku as a server
* Octopress as bloggin platform
* Couple of gems to make things working.


I hope people will find it useful. In case you face any problem to the this code up and running. Feel free to contact me.
