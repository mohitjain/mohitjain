Being a rails developer, Lot of time I spend on rails console. Ever thought of rollback all changes you have done on console? Yes? Here is a quick tip for you ;)


{% highlight ruby %}

rails c --sandbox
Loading development environment in sandbox.
Any modifications you make will be rolled back on exit.
>>

{% endhighlight %}

You can also use -s as a flag instead of â€“sandbox. Awesome!
