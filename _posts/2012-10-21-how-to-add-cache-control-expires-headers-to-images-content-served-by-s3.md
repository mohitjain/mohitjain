Few days back I made a blog post [Save image as progressive image using paperclip and imageMagick][1]. Here is an another improvement in that list.

 [1]: http://www.codebeerstartups.com/save-image-as-progressive-image-using-paperclip-and-imagemagick/

Adding cache control and expiry headers. Caching images improves the user experience and reduces S3 costs. It improves the userâ€™s experience because web pages load quicker as images are already cached and it reduces S3 costs since you have fewer transfers.

From the previous blog post:

##Before:

{% highlight ruby %}
has_attached_file :attachment, {
    :styles => {
      :medium => ["654x500>", :jpg],
      :thumb =>["200x200#", :jpg]
    }
{% endhighlight %}

##After:

{% highlight ruby %}
has_attached_file :attachment, {
    :styles => {
      :medium => ["654x500>", :jpg],
      :thumb =>["200x200#", :jpg]
    },
    :convert_options => {
      :medium => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane",
      :thumb => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane"
      }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
##Another improvement:
{% highlight ruby %}
has_attached_file :attachment, {
  :styles => {
    :medium => ["654x500>", :jpg],
    :thumb =>["200x200#", :jpg]
  },
  :convert_options => {
    :medium => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane",
    :thumb => "-quality 80 -interlace Plane"
  },
  :s3_headers => { 'Cache-Control' => 'max-age=315576000', 'Expires' => 10.years.from_now.httpdate }
  }.merge(PAPERCLIP_STORAGE_OPTIONS)
{% endhighlight %}
